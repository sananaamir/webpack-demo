# Webpack Demo
This project is a simple implementation of webpack so that developers can understand the concepts of webpack in isolation.
Looking at webpack configs in an application can be very overwhelming and confusing because 
of all the other code configs that we see in the project. Once you understand the webpack concepts in isolation, you'll realize that
integrating webpack in an application is very simple and the concepts are very intuitive.
